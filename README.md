### EDICFaces

A simple python script that pulls the names of the PhD students at EDIC in EPFL and creates an HTML file to display the pictures with the names.

This is a help for people at EDIC who are not good with names.

The resulting page : [EDIC Faces](http://fakufaku.github.com/EDICFaces/)

To run the script type :

> python ./EDICFaces.py
